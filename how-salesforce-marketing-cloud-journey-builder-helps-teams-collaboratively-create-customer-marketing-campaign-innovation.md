The Salesforce Marketing Cloud Journey Builder allows the campaign designer to implement and easily share complex marketing requirements. Components of Journey Builder allow events to be triggered and activities to be performed using a user interface that describes the campaign as a flow of objects.

##How Salesforce Marketing Cloud Journey Builder works ...

1. **First there is a customer campaign goal.** The process of defining a goals is important because it helps to communicate the objective of the campaign and share progress.
2. **Second there is a trigger event to start the customer journey campaign.** Data that is used in a campaign must be first integrated into the Salesforce Marketing Cloud platform. Once data is available campaign event triggers can be used to manage campaigns. A call to an API or the contents of a field can be used to start a campaign. Where event triggers depend on calculations and complex relationships data can be pre-processed a query interaction. Where queries are used data is updated to the data extension (or table) associated with Journey Builder campaign. In some cases the contact builder can also be used to manage complex data requirements.
3. **Finally execution of activities are manage by decisions and waits.** Activities consist of sends, waits and updates. There is also the option for building custom activities. All activities can be managed by the same rules that are used to trigger the start of the customer journey campaign.

This user interface of the Salesforce Marketing Cloud Journey Builder enables teams to easy understand how customer journey campaign are executed. Gone is the campaign code only understood by programmers. With this ease of use comes the ability for teams to apply an iterative design process where all parts of the campaign are tested.

Customer marketing campaign innovation occurs as teams collaboratively engage, easily implement changes and seek to maximise return on resources.
