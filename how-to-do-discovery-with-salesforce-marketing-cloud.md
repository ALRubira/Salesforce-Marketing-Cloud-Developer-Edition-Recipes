#How to do discovery with Salesforce Marketing Cloud

Configuration in Salesforce Marketing Cloud is flexible and can be adapted to map closely to business and campaign requirements. When making recommendations a key consideration is user expertise and experience with the platform.

Generally when doing discovery there will be 2 phases of information gathering, these are:

* **Core configuration** - examples of core configuration items include: business unit requirement gathering; primary domain that will be used for sends; description for how the subscriber will be modeled; and how will data be integrated.
* **Campaign configuration** - examples of campaign configuration items include: campaign content and data workflows.
