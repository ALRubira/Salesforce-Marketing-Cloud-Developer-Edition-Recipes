#How to do discovery with Salesforce Marketing Cloud

Configuration in Salesforce Marketing Cloud is flexible and can be adapted to map closely to business and campaign requirements. When making recommendations a key consideration is user expertise and experience with the platform.

When setting up a Marketing Cloud account there are 2 distinct phases consisting ofcore account configuration and then campaign configuration.

##Discovery Process

Set-up of the Marketing Cloud account occurs after purchase. At this stage, Salesforce will have provisioned key aspects of the Marketing Cloud account ready for configuration and  the client will have defined a SOW (Statement Of Work) defining a high-level list of what is required, project-specific activities, deliverables, and timelines for a vendor providing services to the client. 

Using the high-level requirements listed in the SOW a Functional Specification Document (or Blue Print Document) is developed that describes how to achieve the requirements. Functional documentation includes data design in the Marketing Cloud account, data integration and business unit requirements. During enablement of a Marketing Cloud account core configuration can occur. Core configuration includes setup of SAP, RMM, business units, user roles and sender profiles.

#Branding and Creative Strategies

A branding strategy seeks to interact with the customer that a marketing communication. Design is used to strengthen a and convey a consistent message to the consumer. Tools in the Marketing Cloud that can be employed to help achieve this are:

* **Content templates** - to ensure a consist message is communicated.
* **Approval workflows** - to ensure that only approved communicates are sent.
* **Journey Builder** - used to engage the customer in multi-channel communications.

For campaigns or customer journeys to be implemented information is required about campaign content and how this relates to data stored in the Marketing Cloud account about the subscriber.

Data integration with external systems includes file load for batch processes, APIs for real-time process and Salesforce connectors for CRM. Using these the Marketing Cloud can use data source inputs from external POS, CRM, e-commerce and data warehouse systems.

Considerations for how a campaign will be implemented include frequency, complexity and volume of sending.
